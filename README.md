# Pi Collisions

Go to https://terkadur.github.io/pi_collisions/ to view the simulation.

Press Option + âŒ˜ + J (on macOS), or Shift + CTRL + J (on Windows/Linux) to open the console on Google Chrome.

To prepare the simulation, type "prep(M)" (replace M with your desired mass) into the console and press enter to create the first block of mass 1 and the second block of mass M.

To start the simulation, type "start()" into the console and press enter. The number of collisions will be counted automatically in the console.

To restart the simulation, simply refresh the page.

Use your mouse wheel to speed up or slow down the simulation (useful for late in the simulation when distances are large and velocities are small).

To see pi emerge from the number of collisions, set M to a power of 100 (not too large).
